This repo was created for the purpose of storing and versioning any planning documents related to Project: Good Work (P:GW?).

### WTF is this for?

I'm trying to explain - this is another attempt.

What the hell can we do that is worth money, that doesn't require working for yet another shit company? 5 years has been enough for me, not sure about everyone else - but it's not like how it used to be where you'd do 30+ years and retire.

Now it seems like most places - there's frequent layoffs, downsizing, harsh deadlines, no time for training on the job. Do something well? You get bought out, or one of the big tech companies does what you're doing - and tries to crush you.

I've had my own problems with being understaffed, overworked, punished when I fail after a solid 3 years... and then what happened next ofc.

If we decide to work on something - how do we solve these issues?

### WTF Do we do?

General Instructions:

- Make your own branch, so you have your own 'timeline' of documents.
- Create your own folder - tag it `cubicle/<your-name-here>`
- Feel free to edit anything in the repo, while on your own branch. It's git - so as far as I know it'd be hard to screw over anyone. (If I'm wrong, please do share)

#### What should go in this repo?

- ANYTHING.
  - Unless that doesn't work - worry about exceptions later.
  - Try and do whatever you think is clever - if git can handle it, go for it.

## Do shit, abuse shit, break shit, see what does or doesn't work.

I don't think we need to `think outside the box` because that's bullshit - other people put you in a box. Don't think outside the damn box, just get out of the damn box. Until we get in our box - if we want to. It's a dumb metaphor anyways.

## One Request

Don't discard the way something is done because it's 'confusing' - I like what I've heard so far when that is brought up. That's good, let's do more.

We're here as problem solvers first and foremost - making a better career by starting a business is only one avenue I think.Consider what your skills qualify you for - not just programming.

Are there skills you would like to pick up, or would be willing to pick up in order to _have_ a better job? If we work 'indie', consider that you likely won't have a choice, as it will be just us.

We will need to navigate financial and legal challenges, not just typical 'work' challenges we face. A lot of people say it's worth it, so I'd like to see why that is. Expect that we will stay small scale - but don't be afraid to consider big picture or potential timelines where we get HUEG.

I have no fucking idea what I'm doing - I should probably look up the story on how other companies get up and go... Or someone else? We're all in this together in some fashion.
I know I'm not working, so I'll try to get some things down - but I will ask this:

- If I make no sense, <u>ask wtf I'm trying to say</u>,
- If it could have been shorter, <u>help me figure out how</u>.
- If I sound crazy, <u>tell me why</u>
- etc

I'm recognizing now that the reason I fail when I try to organize things in the past, is because no on understands wtf I'm trying to do. If you feel that way - please speak up!

Also, keep in mind that we're from different backgrounds, different levels of experiences, and fields as well. From what I found about what CS ACTUALLY enables you to do, if you just wanted to program... we took the hardest damn path to get there. I think most of us are on that page atm.
